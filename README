Objectives

* cache tolerant (full page cache)
* no library dependency (has to happen quick and early)
* pluggability to reporting outlets (Google Analytics, Omniture)
* easy to use (so easy I can use it)
* toggle doms (render two doms and abrat will display correct one)


Magic happens in three steps
1) configuration object in head or right before script is called
2) call script right after opening body tag 
3) implement reporting outlet (here you can use your library thingies since
you are probably gonna wait till the dom is ready)

this needs to happen in that order
